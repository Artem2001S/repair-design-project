## Getting start
Clone this repository, open index.html to see the result of the work.
## Deployment
In this project I used preprocessor SCSS. Also I used "Live SASS Compiler" for VSCode to translate SCSS to CSS.
- Install VS Code
- Install "Live SASS Compiler" extension (for VS Code)
- Go to VS Code setting and find settings for "Live SASS Compiler" 
- Click "Edit in settings.json" and insert this setting
 `` {
    "liveSassCompile.settings.formats":[
    {
        "format": "expanded",
        "extensionName": ".css",
        "savePath": "./style/css/"
    }],
    "explorer.confirmDelete": false
    }``
- Click "Watch SASS" (There is "Watch SASS" button on VS Code status bar panel)

- #### It is recommended to install "Live Server" extension.
